### Introduction

This is my personal portfolio website to highlight my skills and experience in backend development.

### Deployment

This website is currently hosted on [netlify](https://ma-ningzhi.netlify.app/)

### Reference

I followed through this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/ldwlOzRvYOU?si=JF97t34n6IPobbMg) and made relevant modifications, which I also gained precious insight into frontend development using HTML and CSS.
